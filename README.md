# Handwriting Recognition using OpenCV, Keras , TensorFlow and ResNet Architecture

## Background of the project:-<br>
Utilized two datasets :<br>
1.The standard MNIST 0-9 dataset by LeCun et al.<br>
2. The Kaggle A-Z dataset by Sachin Patel, based on the NIST Special Database 19<br>

Trained the OCR model using Keras, TensorFlow, and deep learning architecture, ResNet.<br>

## About different libraries and platforms used:-<br>
Used OpenCV for image pre-processing (improve the image quality by removing noise and enhancing the contrast between the handwritten text and the background).<br>

Keras is a high-level neural networks API built on top of TensorFlow, used Keras to provide a range of pre-built layers that can are easily combined.It is written in Python and is used to make the implementation of neural networks easy<br>

TensorFlow can handle large datasets and is used to scale models across multiple devices, making it easier to train large models.<br>
The TensorFlow platform helps you implement best practices for data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining.<br>
ResNet uses a particular block called a residual block that allows the model to learn features from images, making it possible to create much deeper networks without encountering problems with vanishing gradients.<br>
